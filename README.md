# p8cypk
A cyberpunk pico-8 game

Developed by NoÃ«lle Anthony at Mischievess Studios.

Still in the very earliest stages of development; it doesn't have a name, assets, or even a central mechanic. We'll call it p8cypk for now.

p8cypk is not currently associated with a license and its code and assets should not be used without permission from the author. This may change in the future.
